Two new major modes for emacs, written in elisp

elf.el (elf-mode) - syntax highlighting for elf64-x86-64 files (produced by objdump)

basic-hexl.el (basic-hexl-mode) - a simple version of hexl-mode that allows you to edit the hex values directly

How to use: 
make sure both files are in the same directory, load basic-hexl.el, which will load elf.el. 

use basic-hexl-mode on a binary file
and try the command basic-hexl-disassemble

I had an odd bug with dependencies and loading where if I didn't call hexl-mode at least once before loading my-hexl it doesn't find my-hexl. I think it went away
